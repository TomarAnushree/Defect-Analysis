## Defect Analysis 

This project was related to analysis of Glass Defects in the client data during the production.
The dataset contains attributes like **Date**,**Shift**,**Hour no.**,**Line no.**,**Product**,**Defect Name**,**No. of Occurance**
**Section No.**,**Operator Name**,**Primary Cause**,and **Root Cause Category**.

|  | Defect | 
|--|--------|
|D1 |Top seam|
|D2	|Stuck glass|
|D3	|Glass spike|
|D4	|Bird swing|
|D5	|Bird cage|


## Solutions

* Performed Exploratory data analysis to find relevant pattern among Primary cause, Root Cause and Type of Defects using Clustering Technique. 
* Analysed Hourly,Monthly and Shift wise total number of occuance of Defects.
* Developed a classification model using Machine Learning algorithm as *Random Forest*,*Naive Bayes* and *KNN*.
